BMR missing description


are these the frequency per day(otherwise missing data for frequency per day)?

these are in capital in the variable description
l1(L1)
l2(L2)
l3(L3)
l5a(L5a)
l5b(L5b)
l5c(L5c)

efter_090901....missing variable indicating whether it is after 2009-09-01, due to some changes in measurements after that time, i guess the datum will have to be used?
