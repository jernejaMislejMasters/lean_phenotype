The LTHthesis class assumes a standard TeXlive or MikTeX installation
and specifically requires the packages

* memoir
* amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb
* ntheorem,latexsym,framed
* biblatex

If you don't have them already, they should be easily installable 
using your standard package manager.

The 'memoir' class, which is used by LTHthesis, is quite comprehensive,
and many of the commonly used auxiliary packages are unnecessary, and in
many cases counterproductive.

* caption, subcaption. The correct format for captions is already set.
                       If you need something like subfigures, please see
	http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/116807/subfigure-with-memoir

* theorem. The correct format for theorems is already set, using
           the package ntheorem.

* fancyheadings. The headers and footers have their correct format.
